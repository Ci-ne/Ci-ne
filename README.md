# My Programming journey

Most journeys have a beginning and a desired destination. But maybe not my adventure into programming.
## Genesis

Programming for me started in JHS 2, when my uncle thought it wise that I acquire some of the skills that could possibly determine the future. And so he got me a teacher who taught me the basics; HTML. 
I decided to build a webiste for my JHS class and this led me even deeper into HTML and then later CSS.

A sudden turn of events left me on my own in this journey and I turned to Mozilla Firefox's developper recommendations to further these skills. Through it, I discovered Codeacadmey and W3 schools. 

Fast forward to SHS 1 and I discovered *Develpers In Vogue (</div>)*, a tech group passionate about women in coding and signed up for their Speak Python bootcamp v2. With little knowledge of this language, I barely understood anything, but it opened my mind to a whole new world in programming. 

Combining academic work and coding was near impossible, and lack of use facilitated my forgetting almost everything I have learned. So here I am in my first year in Univeristy, picking up the pieces and continuing this journey where I left off; in Python, trying to make the most of every opportunity to learn more, to see what I could possibly use this skill for.

## The End?

The world of programming is limitless, brimming with opportunities. 

I have no idea where it will take me, but I do know I want to use it to make a difference in society, in the lives of those who think they don't matter. 

To let their voices be heard.

To help them connect with those who can help them solve their problems. 



To solve problems.




# JHS Class Website 

This work remains my greatest programming feat ever. 
It inspired me to explore the world of HTML and CSS on my own, and explore my love for color and art in a different environment.

Through it I came to know of different classes of objects, tags and features of these two languages.
Many thanks to my uncle for allowing me to perch on his website ;-)
